# Thornvale
> A cozy third-person village adventure where friendship is a mechanic — and conformity is the cost.

## What is Thornvale?
**Thornvale** is a warm, cottage-core valley town that feels like a hug… until you notice the hug has a grip strength rating.

You arrive in a picture-perfect hamlet of mossy roofs, lantern-lit paths, and neighbors who *really* want to help. By day, it plays like a wholesome village sim: explore, craft, decorate, forage, run errands, and build relationships. By night, the town’s “welcoming” vibe twists into something uncanny: paths subtly rearrange, villagers repeat phrases like they’re reading from a script, and the hedges—heavy with thorns—feel like they’re listening.

The deeper you bond with Thornvale, the clearer it becomes: **community here is a system. Kindness is currency. Routine is law.**

## Core Hook
A cozy town game where the central mystery is:
**Are these people protecting you… or keeping you?**

## Gameplay Loop
### Day (Cozy Mode)
- Forage, fish, garden, craft, and decorate your cottage
- Help villagers with “wholesome” quests that unlock areas and upgrades
- Build relationships and learn local secrets through dialogue + favors
- Earn trust (and benefits) through participation in town routines

### Night (Uncanny Mode)
- Investigate anomalies and “impossible” changes in the environment
- Decode rules you were never explicitly told
- Survive “polite interventions” when you break the pattern
- Uncover what Thornvale is, what it wants, and why you were chosen

## Story Premise
You arrive in Thornvale for a fresh start — or chasing something that brought you here: a missing person, a strange job posting, a letter you don’t remember writing.

The town welcomes you immediately, almost *too* immediately. Everyone is kind in the same ways, at the same times, using the same phrases. It’s comforting… until it’s not.

Your choices shape the truth you uncover and what Thornvale becomes:
- **Assimilate:** become a pillar of the community (and inherit its power)
- **Escape:** break the loop and survive what follows you out
- **Rewrite:** expose the mechanism and change the town’s rules from within

## Design Pillars
- **Cozy with teeth:** warmth and charm, with a steady undercurrent of dread
- **Social horror:** the fear isn’t gore — it’s pressure, politeness, and conformity
- **Familiar, then wrong:** the world stays beautiful while reality bends around you
- **Player agency:** your relationship choices affect your safety, access, and ending

## Signature Unsettling Detail
Everyone is friendly… **in exactly the same way.**
Same phrasing. Same smiles. Same “helpful” nudges toward the approved path.

And the town keeps score.

## Key Systems (Concept)
- **Neighborliness (Reputation):** town-wide trust level that unlocks perks… and scrutiny
- **Routine System:** daily rituals that reward compliance and punish disruption
- **Anomaly Director:** dynamic “one weird thing” events (subtle → overt) that escalate
- **Polite Interventions:** NPCs and environment react to “rule breaks” with escalating softness
- **Cozy Progression / Uncanny Resistance:** upgrades help with crafting *and* surviving the weird

## Tone & Vibe
Think: **Garden Grove comfort** + **The Nudge unease**  
Warm lamplight, handmade charm, soft music… and one detail that’s always slightly off.

Keywords: *cottagecore, folk-horror, uncanny social pressure, “nice” dystopia, pretty paranoia.*

## Current Status
- **Concept + narrative pillars:** ✅
- **Core loop definition:** ✅
- **Prototype target:** third-person exploration + day/night toggle + first anomaly set

## Roadmap (High-Level)
1. **Prototype**
   - Third-person controller + camera
   - Small village block + cottage interior
   - Day/Night switch + first “anomaly” events
2. **Vertical Slice**
   - 3 villagers with relationship arcs
   - Neighborliness meter + routine quests
   - One full nightly investigation chain
3. **Alpha**
   - Expanded town zones
   - More anomaly variety + escalation logic
   - Multiple ending paths implemented

## Want to Collaborate?
If you’re into cozy games, narrative design, environment art, or systems that are secretly psychological warfare in a cardigan:
- Open an Issue with **ideas / mechanics / references**
- Or drop a pitch for a small contribution (quest chain, anomaly concept, NPC archetype)
