# Thornvale Wiki

**Thornvale** is a cozy third-person browser adventure where friendship is a mechanic—and conformity is the cost.

### What we’re building (TL;DR)

A playable **town slice** in the browser (Three.js) that already feels like a game:

* Third-person controller + camera
* Simple town block to explore
* Day/Night toggle
* A couple interactables

### Active Work

**Current milestone:** Milestone 1 — Third-Person Controller + Simple Town Scene

**Next 3 tasks**

1. Ship controller + camera rig (feels-good baseline)
2. Load town block + ground/collision
3. Add 2 interactables + day/night toggle

**Open questions**

* Physics approach for MVP: raycast grounding + simple colliders vs full physics engine?
* Asset budget targets for town slice?
