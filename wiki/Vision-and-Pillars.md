# Vision & Pillars

## The Core Hook

A cozy town game where the central mystery is:
**Are these people protecting you… or keeping you?**

## Tone

**Warm cottage-core with one unsettling detail.**

* Beautiful, handmade, inviting
* The “wrongness” is subtle and social
* No gore needed—pressure and politeness do the work

## Narrative Thesis

**Dystopian friendship:** belonging becomes a system.

* Kindness can be currency
* Routine can be law
* Community can be a cage

## Design Pillars

1. **Cozy with teeth** — charm first, menace underneath
2. **Social horror** — fear is pressure, politeness, scrutiny
3. **Familiar, then wrong** — the world stays pretty while reality bends
4. **Player agency** — choices shape access, safety, and ending
5. **Shippable slices** — build in small playable chunks

## Hard Non-Goals (for now)

* No wallets, no token gating
* No massive open world on day one
* No complex AI NPC sim until the core loop is fun
